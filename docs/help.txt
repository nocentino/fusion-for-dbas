SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2ProtectionGroup [-AllowErrors <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Filter <String>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Name <String>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays a list of protection groups, including their associated source arrays, replication targets, hosts count, host groups count, and volumes count. The list includes protection groups that were created on the local array to replicate snapshot data to other arrays or offload targets, created on a remote array and replicated asynchronously to this array, or created inside a pod on a remote array and stretched to the local array.
    

PARAMETERS

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

NAME
    Get-Pfa2ArraysPerformanceByLink
    
SYNOPSIS
    List array front-end IO performance data by link
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2ArraysPerformanceByLink [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-EndTime <DateTime>] [-Filter <String>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Resolution <Int64>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-StartTime <DateTime>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays real-time and historical front-end performance data at the array level including latency, bandwidth, IOPS, average I/O size, and queue depth. Group output is shown by link. A link represents a set of arrays that an I/O operation depends on. For local-only I/Os, this is a local array. For mirrored I/Os, this is a set of synchronous replication peer arrays.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

NAME
    Get-Pfa2HostGroupPerformanceByArray
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.0+) List host group performance data by array
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2HostGroupPerformanceByArray [-AllowErrors <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-EndTime <DateTime>] [-Filter <String>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Name <String>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Resolution <Int64>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-StartTime <DateTime>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency data, and average I/O size data. The data is displayed by total size across all host groups on each array and by individual host group on each array. The displayed data represents the volumes that are connected to a host group on the current array and the volumes that are connected to a host group on any remote arrays that are visible to the current array.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllowErrors <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, the API will allow the operation to continue even if there are errors. Any errors will be returned in the `errors` field of the response. If set to `$False`, the operation will fail if there are any errors.

For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

NAME
    Get-Pfa2HostPerformanceByArray
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.0+) List host performance data by array
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2HostPerformanceByArray [-AllowErrors <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-EndTime <DateTime>] [-Filter <String>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Name <String>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Resolution <Int64>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-StartTime <DateTime>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency data, and average I/O size data. The data is displayed by total size across all hosts on each array and by individual host on each array. The displayed data represents the volumes that are connected to a host on the current array and the volumes that are connected to a host on any remote arrays that are visible to the current array.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllowErrors <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, the API will allow the operation to continue even if there are errors. Any errors will be returned in the `errors` field of the response. If set to `$False`, the operation will fail if there are any errors.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Resolution <Int64>
        The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -StartTime <DateTime>
        Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `StartTime` is the beginning of the time window, and `EndTime` is the end of the time window. The `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters are specified as DateTime. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `Resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Resolution <Int64>
        The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours).

        Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `StartTime` is the beginning of the time window, and `EndTime` is the end of the time window. The `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters are specified as DateTime. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `Resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `Resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Resolution <Int64>
        The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) List protection groups
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2ProtectionGroup [-AllowErrors <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Filter <String>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Name <String>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays a list of protection groups, including their associated source arrays, replication targets, hosts count, host groups count, and volumes count. The list includes protection groups that were created on the local array to replicate snapshot data to other arrays or offload targets, created on a remote array and replicated asynchronously to this array, or created inside a pod on a remote array and stretched to the local array.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Resolution <Int64>
        The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

DESCRIPTION
    Displays a list of vchost-connections between the protocol endpoint and vchost.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllVchosts <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, the storage container represented by the protocol endpoint is accessible to all vchosts. Users should not specify `VchostId` or `VchostName` in the request. If set to `$False`, the storage container represented by the protocol endpoint is only accessible to the vchosts that have explicit vchost-connections with the protocol endpoint. Users need to specify `VchostId` or `VchostName` in the request.

NAME
    Get-Pfa2VirtualMachine
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.14+) List Virtual Machines
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2VirtualMachine [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Filter <String>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-VmId <List<String>>] [-VmType <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays a list of virtual machines, including those pending eradication. If `VmType` is `vvol`, the `recovery_context` in the response will represent the most recent snapshot of the config vVol. This must be used as the `source` in the `Update-Pfa2VirtualMachine` method when recovering a virtual machine from the destroyed state.

To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

NAME
    Get-Pfa2VirtualMachineSnapshot
    
SYNOPSIS
    List Virtual Machine Snapshots
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-Pfa2VirtualMachineSnapshot [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Filter <String>] [-Limit <Int32>] [-Offset <Int32>] [-Sort <List<String>>] [-VmId <List<String>>] [-VmType <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Displays a list of virtual machine snapshots, including those pending eradication. If `VmType` is `vvol`, the `recovery_context` in the response will represent a protection group snapshot containing the virtual machine. This must be used as the `source` in the `New-Pfa2VirtualMachineSnapshot /virtual-machine` method when recovering or overwriting a virtual machine from a snapshot.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -StartTime <DateTime>
        Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `StartTime` is the beginning of the time window, and `EndTime` is the end of the time window. The `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters are specified as DateTime. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `Resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `Resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

    -StartTime <DateTime>
        Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `StartTime` is the beginning of the time window, and `EndTime` is the end of the time window. The `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters are specified as DateTime. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `Resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `Resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Resolution <Int64>
        The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours).

Include the `StartTime` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `StartTime` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `EndTime` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `EndTime`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `Resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `StartTime` or `EndTime` parameter is, then `Resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

    -Sort <List<String>>
        Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `Sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names.

        The maximum role allowed for ID Tokens issued by this API client. The bearer of an access token will be authorized to perform actions within the intersection of this MaxRole and the role of the array user specified as the JWT sub (subject) claim. Valid max_role values are readonly, ops_admin, array_admin, and storage_admin. Users with the readonly (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey the state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the ops_admin (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops Admin users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the storage_admin (Storage Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus storage related operations, such as administering volumes, hosts, and host groups. Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and system configurations. Users with the array_admin (Array Admin) role can perform the same operations as Storage Admin users plus array-wide changes dealing with global and system configurations. In other words, Array Admin users can perform all operations.

NAME
    New-Pfa2ArrayFactoryResetToken
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.4+) Create a factory reset token
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2ArrayFactoryResetToken [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a token that can be used to perform a factory reset on the array. Factory reset tokens can only be created after the array has been prepared for reset (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must first be eradicated). After a token has been created, operations that would take the array out of the prepared state are disabled (e.g., creating volumes) until all tokens have been deleted.

    -ContextNames <List<String>>
        Performs the operation on the context specified. If specified, the context names must be an array of size 1, and the single element must be the name of an array in the same fleet. If not specified, the context will default to the array that received this request.  Other parameters provided with the request, such as names of volumes or snapshots, are resolved relative to the provided `context`.
        
        Required?                    false

        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Lun <Int32>
        The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are to address the specified volume. If the LUN is not specified, the system automatically assigns a LUN to the connection. To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts at LUN `1` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts at LUN `254` and counts down to the minimum LUN `1`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the `[1...254]` range are taken, the system starts at LUN `255` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. Should not be used together with an NVMe host or host group.

SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2Directory [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-DirectoryName <String>] [-FileSystemId <List<String>>] [-FileSystemName <List<String>>] [-Name <String>] [-Path <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a managed directory at the specified path. The managed directory name must consist of a file system name prefix and a managed directory name suffix (separated with ':'). The suffix must be between 1 and 63 characters (alphanumeric and '-') in length and begin and end with a letter or number. The suffix must include at least one letter or '-'. Set `Name` to create a managed directory with the specified full managed directory name, or set `FileSystemName` or `FileSystemId` in the query parameters and `suffix` in the body parameters to create a managed directory in the specified file system with the specified suffix. These two options are exclusive.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates an NLM reclamation, which is a system-wide operation that affects all clients, so only one may be in progress at a time. Attempting to initiate reclamation while one is in progress will result in an error. When NLM reclamation is initiated, all NLM locks are deleted and client applications are notified that they can reacquire their locks within a grace period.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a file copy from one path to another path. The `DirectoryId`, `DirectoryName` or `Paths` value must be specified. If the `DirectoryId` or `DirectoryName` value is not specified, the file is copied to the source directory specified in the body params. The `Paths` value refers to the path of the target file relative to the target directory. If `Paths` value is not specified, the file will be copied to the relative path specified in `SourcePath` under the target directory. The `SourcePath` value refers to the path of the source file relative to the source directory. To overwrite an existing file, set the `Overwrite` flag to `$True`.

NAME
    New-Pfa2FleetMember
    
SYNOPSIS
    Add members to a fleet
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2FleetMember [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-FleetId <List<String>>] [-FleetName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-MemberResourceType <List<String>>] [-MembersKey <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Adds arrays to an existing fleet. This API needs to be run from the array that's joining the fleet.  To add the current array to the fleet, specify its own array `MemberId` or `MemberName`, as well as the `fleet key` generated on any array already in the fleet. `MemberResourceType` is `remote-arrays`. The array's `ID` and `MemberName` can be retrieved with a call to `Get-Pfa2FleetMember /arrays` on the array.

DESCRIPTION
    Create a membership between a host and a host group. Adding a membership to a host group automatically connects the host to all volumes associated with the group. Multiple hosts can be belong to a host group, but a host can only belong to one host group. Hosts can be added to host groups at any time. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together, and only one host group can be specified at a time.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a host group member and assigns to a protection group. Members that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host group. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    New-Pfa2HostHostGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Create a membership to a host group
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2HostHostGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a membership to a host group. Creating a membership to a host group automatically connects the host to all volumes associated with the group. Multiple hosts can be belong to a host group, but a host can only belong to one host group. Hosts can be added to host groups at any time. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together, and only one host group can be specified at a time.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a host member and adds it to a protection group. Members that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group.

NAME
    New-Pfa2Pod
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Create a pod
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2Pod [-AllowThrottle <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-FailoverPreferencesId <List<String>>] [-FailoverPreferencesName <List<String>>] [-Name <String>] [-QuotaLimit <Int64>] [-SourceId <String>] [-SourceName <String>] [-TagsCopyable <System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Boolean]>] [-TagsKey <List<String>>] [-TagsNamespace <List<String>>] [-TagsValue <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a pod on the local array. Each pod must be given a unique name across the arrays to which they are stretched. A pod cannot be stretched to an array that already contains a pod with the same name. After a pod has been created, add volumes and protection groups, and then stretch the pod to another connected array. Known issue: cmdlet claims to create pod with tags, however tag related parameters are silently ignored. As a workaround, use cmdlet Set-Pfa2PodTagBatch to create or update tags for Pod object.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllowThrottle <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, allows operation to fail if array health is not optimal.

    New-Pfa2PodArray [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a pod to be stretched to an array. When a pod is stretched to an array, the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously replicated. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the pod to be stretched. The `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the array over which the pod is to be stretched. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together. (Deprecated) Use pods/members instead.

NAME
    New-Pfa2PodReplicaLink
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.2+) Create pod replica links
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2PodReplicaLink [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-LocalPodId <List<String>>] [-LocalPodName <List<String>>] [-RemoteId <List<String>>] [-RemoteName <List<String>>] [-RemotePodId <List<String>>] [-RemotePodName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates pod replica links between two arrays. The `LocalPodName` and `RemotePodName` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

    -RulesAccess <List<String>>
        Specifies access control for the export. Valid values include `root-squash`, `all-squash`, and `no-root-squash`. The value `root-squash` prevents client users and groups with root privilege from mapping their root privilege to a file system. All users with UID 0 will have their UID mapped to `RulesAnonuid`. All users with GID 0 will have their GID mapped to `RulesAnongid`. The value `all-squash` maps all UIDs (including root) to `RulesAnonuid` and all GIDs (including root) to `RulesAnongid`. The value `no-root-squash` allows users and groups to access the file system with their UIDs and GIDs. If not specified, the default value is `root-squash`.

    -RulesSecurity <System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String]]>
        The security flavors to use for accessing files on this mount point. Values include `auth_sys`, `krb5`, `krb5i`, and `krb5p`. If the server does not support the requested flavor, the mount operation fails. This operation updates all rules of the specified policy. If `auth_sys`, the client is trusted to specify the identity of the user. If `krb5`, cryptographic proof of the identity of the user is provided in each RPC request. This provides strong verification of the identity of users accessing data on the server. Note that additional configuration besides adding this mount option is required to enable Kerberos security. If `krb5i`, integrity checking is added to krb5. This ensures the data has not been tampered with. If `krb5p`, integrity checking and encryption is added to krb5. This is the most secure setting, but it also involves the most performance overhead.

    New-Pfa2PolicySmb [-AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-ContinuousAvailabilityEnabled <Boolean>] [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-Name <String>] [-PolicyMappingMapping <String>] [-SourceId <List<String>>] [-SourceName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates one or more SMB policies. To copy a policy, set one of either `SourceName` or `SourceId`. Each policy can only have one entry. To create a policy from scratch, policy body is required. To create an SMB policy with access based enumeration enabled, set `AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled=$True`. To create an SMB policy with continuous availability enabled, set `continuous_availability=$True`.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled <Boolean>
        (REST API 2.4+) If set to `$True`, enables access based enumeration on the policy. When access based enumeration is enabled on a policy, files and folders within exports that are attached to the policy will be hidden from users who do not have permission to view them. If not specified, defaults to `$False`.

    -RulesSuffix <List<String>>
        (REST API 2.9+) The snapshot suffix name. A full snapshot name is constructed in the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the snapshot client name, and `SUFFIX` is the snapshot suffix. The client-visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`. The `RulesSuffix` value can only be set for one rule in the same policy. The `RulesSuffix` value can only be set on a rule with the same `RulesKeepFor` value and `RulesEvery` value. The `RulesSuffix` value can only be set on the rule with the largest `RulesKeepFor` value. If not specified, defaults to a monotonically increasing number generated by the system.

SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Create an action to add a host to a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2ProtectionGroupHost [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates an action to add a host member to a protection group. Members that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    New-Pfa2SoftwareInstallation
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.3+) Create a software upgrade
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2SoftwareInstallation [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-Mode <String>] [-OverrideChecksArgs <List<String>>] [-OverrideChecksName <List<String>>] [-OverrideChecksPersistent <System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Boolean]>] -SoftwareId <List<String>> [-UpgradeParametersName <List<String>>] [-UpgradeParametersValue <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates and initiates a software upgrade.
    

PARAMETERS
    -ApiVersion <String>
        alternative API version
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None

        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Array <Rest2Api>
        The PureArray object representing a connection to a Pure Storage FlashArray. Created using the `Connect-Pfa2Array` cmdlet.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Mode <String>
        Mode that the upgrade is in. Valid values are `check-only`, `interactive`, `semi-interactive`, and `one-click`. The `check_only` mode is deprecated. Use `/software-checks`. In this mode, the upgrade only runs pre-upgrade checks and returns. In `interactive` mode, the upgrade pauses at several points, at which users must enter certain commands to proceed. In `semi-interactive` mode, the upgrade pauses if there are any upgrade check failures and functions like `one-click` mode otherwise. In `one-click` mode, the upgrade proceeds automatically without pausing.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -OverrideChecksArgs <List<String>>
        The name of the specific check within the override check to ignore so that the system can continue with the software upgrade. The `OverrideChecksName` parameter of the override check must be specified with the `OverrideChecksArgs` parameter. For example, if the HostIOCheck check fails on hosts host01 and host02, the system displays a list of these host names in the failed check. To override the HostIOCheck checks for host01 and host02, set `OverrideChecksName=HostIOCheck`, and set `OverrideChecksArgs=host01,host02`. Enter multiple `OverrideChecksArgs`. Note that not all checks have `OverrideChecksArgs` values.
        
        reference: OverrideCheck
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None

        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -OverrideChecksName <List<String>>
        The name of the upgrade check to be overridden so the software upgrade can continue if the check failed or is anticipated to fail during the upgrade process. Overriding the check forces the system to ignore the check failure and continue with the upgrade. If the check includes more specific checks that failed or are anticipated to fail, set them using the `OverrideChecksArgs` parameter.

        If set to `$True`, the system always ignores the failure of the specified upgrade check and continues with the upgrade process.  If set to `$False`, the system ignores the failure of the specified upgrade check until the upgrade check finishes and the upgrade process is continued. For example, the `continue` command is successfully issued in an `interactive` mode, or the first upgrade check step successfully finishes in a `one-click` mode.

NAME
    New-Pfa2VchostConnection
    
SYNOPSIS
    Create a vchost-connection between protocol endpoint and vchost.
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2VchostConnection [-AllVchosts <Boolean>] [-AllowStretchedMultiVchost <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ProtocolEndpointId <List<String>>] [-ProtocolEndpointName <List<String>>] [-VchostId <List<String>>] [-VchostName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a vchost-connection between protocol endpoint and vchost. Each vchost is associated with a vCenter. Each protocol endpoint is associated with a storage container. A vchost-connection makes the storage container accessible to the vCenter when the vCenter attempts to mount the container. One of `ProtocolEndpointName` or `ProtocolEndpointId` query parameters and one of `VchostName` or `VchostId` query parameters are required. But if `AllVchosts` is set to `$True`, `VchostName` and `VchostId` should not be specified.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllVchosts <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, the storage container represented by the protocol endpoint is accessible to all vchosts. Users should not specify `VchostId` or `VchostName` in the request. If set to `$False`, the storage container represented by the protocol endpoint is only accessible to the vchosts that have explicit vchost-connections with the protocol endpoint. Users need to specify `VchostId` or `VchostName` in the request.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -AllowStretchedMultiVchost <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, users are allowed to create a new vchost-connection to a stretched container that already has a vchost-connection. In principle, a stretched container can only have one vchost-connection at a time.
        
        Required?                    false

NAME
    New-Pfa2VirtualMachine
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.10+) Create a virtual machine
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2VirtualMachine [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-Id <String>] [-Overwrite <Boolean>] [-SourceId <String>] [-SourceName <String>] [-VmId <String>] [-VmType <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates one or more virtual machines from a protection group snapshot. If the virtual machine is of type `vvol`, the `source` property of the request body must be a `recovery_context` value retrieved from the `Get-Pfa2VirtualMachine /virtual-machine-snapshots` endpoint. If `Overwrite` is specified, an existing virtual machine will have its volumes overwritten by the snapshot. Otherwise, a new virtual machine will be created from the snapshot. If creating the new virtual machine will cause a conflict with an existing virtual machine, the operation will fail.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates one or more virtual storage volumes of the specified size. If `Provisioned` is not specified, the size of the new volume defaults to 1MB. (`Provisioned` sets the virtual size of the volume, measured in bytes. Volume size must be a multiple of 512 bytes between 1 MB and 4PB. Byte multipliers KB, MB, GB, TB and PB are supported, with no space between number and multiplier, such as `1PB`. Maximum value 4503599627370496.) The `Name` query parameter is required. The `AddToProtectionGroupNames` query parameter specifies a list of protection group names that will compose the initial protection for the volume. The `WithDefaultProtection` query parameter specifies whether to use the container default protection configuration for the volume. The `AddToProtectionGroupNames` and `WithDefaultProtection` query parameters cannot be provided when `Overwrite` is `$True`. For more information of creating volumes under SafeMode, run `Get-Help About_Pfa2Safemode`

    -PriorityAdjustmentOperator <String>
        (REST API 2.10+) Valid values are `+`, `-`, and `=`. The values `+` and `-` may be applied to volumes and volume groups to reflect the relative importance of their workloads. Volumes and volume groups can be assigned a priority adjustment of -10, 0, or +10. In addition, volumes can be assigned values of =-10, =0, or =+10. Volumes with settings of -10, 0, +10 can be modified by the priority adjustment setting of a volume group that contains the volume. However, if a volume has a priority adjustment set with the `=` operator (for example, =+10), it retains that value and is unaffected by any volume group priority adjustment settings.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a volume group. The volume group itself does not contain any meaningful content; instead, it acts as a container that is used to organize volumes. Once a volume group has been created, volumes can be created inside the volume group or moved into and out of the volume group.

        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named

    -PriorityAdjustmentOperator <String>
        (REST API 2.10+) Valid values are `+`, `-`, and `=`. The values `+` and `-` may be applied to volumes and volume groups to reflect the relative importance of their workloads. Volumes and volume groups can be assigned a priority adjustment of -10, 0, or +10. In addition, volumes can be assigned values of =-10, =0, or =+10. Volumes with settings of -10, 0, +10 can be modified by the priority adjustment setting of a volume group that contains the volume. However, if a volume has a priority adjustment set with the `=` operator (for example, =+10), it retains that value and is unaffected by any volume group priority adjustment settings.

    New-Pfa2VolumeProtectionGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Create a volume and add it to a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    New-Pfa2VolumeProtectionGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Creates a volume member and adds it to a protection group. Members that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` and `MemberId` parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume. The `GroupName` and only one of `MemberName` or `MemberId` parameters are required and must be set together.

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a point-in-time snapshot of the contents of a volume. The `SourceId` or `SourceName` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AllowThrottle <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, allows snapshot to fail if array health is not optimal.

    -ContextNames <List<String>>
        Performs the operation on the context specified. If specified, the context names must be an array of size 1, and the single element must be the name of an array in the same fleet. If not specified, the context will default to the array that received this request.  Other parameters provided with the request, such as names of volumes or snapshots, are resolved relative to the provided `context`.
        
        Required?                    false

    -Destroyed <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, destroys a resource. Once set to `$True`, the `TimeRemaining` value will display the amount of time left until the destroyed resource is permanently eradicated. Before the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed resource can be recovered by setting `Destroyed=$False`. Once the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the resource is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2Array
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.4+) Delete an array
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2Array [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-EradicateAllData <Boolean>] [-FactoryResetToken <Int64>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes an array. For physical appliances, deleting an array restores the hardware to factory settings. This entails deleting all data, metadata, configuration, and logs. The array returns to the state it was in prior to any configuration changes being made. If the hardware is reused, it must be as a different array with a new ID. For virtual appliances, deleting an array puts it into an unusable state. Virtual resources (e.g., virtual machines) can later be freed, which deletes any remaining data, metadata, configuration, and logs. Prior to factory reset, an array must be manually prepared (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must be eradicated) and a factory reset token must be created.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2HostGroupProtectionGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a host group from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2HostGroupProtectionGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a host group member from a protection group. After the member has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was removed are not affected. Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host group. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2HostProtectionGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a host from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2HostProtectionGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a host member from a protection group. After the member has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was removed are not affected. Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2PodArray
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a pod that was stretched to an array
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2PodArray [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-WithUnknown <Boolean>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a pod that was stretchd to an array, collapsing the pod to a single array. Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays. After a pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version of the pod with 'restretch' appended to the pod name is created on the array that no longer has the pod. The restretched pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod, just before it was unstretched. The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretched pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched. The `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together. (Deprecated) Use pods/members instead.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2PodReplicaLink
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.2+) Delete pod replica links
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2PodReplicaLink [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-LocalPodId <List<String>>] [-LocalPodName <List<String>>] [-RemotePodId <List<String>>] [-RemotePodName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes pod replica links. The `LocalPodName` and `RemotePodName` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupHost
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a host from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupHost [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a host member from a protection group. After the member has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was removed will not be affected. Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupHostGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a host group from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupHostGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a host group member from a protection group. After the member has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Protection group snapshots taken before the member was removed will not be affected. Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` parameter represents the name of the host group. The `GroupName` and `MemberName` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupVolume
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a volume from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2ProtectionGroupVolume [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a volume member from a protection group. After the member has been deleted, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was deleted are not affected. Deleting a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` and `MemberId` parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume. The `GroupName` parameter, and either the `MemberName` or `MemberId` parameters are required and must be set together.

SYNOPSIS
    Delete the vchost-connection between a protocol endpoint and its vchost
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2VchostConnection [-AllVchosts <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ProtocolEndpointId <List<String>>] [-ProtocolEndpointName <List<String>>] [-VchostId <List<String>>] [-VchostName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes the vchost-connection between a protocol endpoint and its vchost. The storage container represented by the protocol endpoint will no longer be visible to the vCenter represented by the vchost. One of the `ProtocolEndpointName` or `ProtocolEndpointId` query parameters, and one of the `VchostName` or `VchostId` query parameters are required. But if `AllVchosts` is set to `$True`, `VchostName` and `VchostId` should not be specified.

NAME
    Remove-Pfa2VolumeProtectionGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Delete a volume from a protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-Pfa2VolumeProtectionGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-GroupId <List<String>>] [-GroupName <List<String>>] [-MemberId <List<String>>] [-MemberName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Deletes a volume member from a protection group. After the member has been deleted, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was deleted are not affected. Deleting a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `GroupName` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `MemberName` and `MemberId` parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume. The `GroupName` and only one of `MemberName` or `MemberId` parameters are required and must be set together.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2ArrayCloudCapacity
    
SYNOPSIS
    Modify CBS array capacity
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2ArrayCloudCapacity [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-RequestedCapacity <Int64>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies the raw capacity of the CBS array. This should trigger a backend process that will update the CBS array capacity. The array capacity can be updated only to values defined by the capacity steps endpoint. When an existing capacity update request is in progress, any new request to update of the capacity will receive an error response. For non-CBS arrays, this feature is not supported and requests will receive an error response.

DESCRIPTION
    Modifies a directory snapshot. You can destroy, recover, or update the policy or time remaining of a directory snapshot. To destroy a directory snapshot, set `Destroyed=$True`. To recover a directory snapshot that has been destroyed and is pending eradication, set `Destroyed=$False`. To rename a directory snapshot, set `DirectorySnapshotName` to the new name. The `Id` or `Name` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.

    -ModifyResourceAccess <String>
        Describes how to modify a resource accesses of a resource when that resource is moved. Possible values are: `none`, `create`, and `delete`. The `none` value indicates that no resource access should be modified. The `create` value is used when a resource is moving out of a realm into the array and it needs to create a resource access of the moved resource to the realm from which it is moving. The `delete` value is used when a resource that is moving from an array into a realm already has a resource access into that realm. This is a required parameter when a resource is being moved to another member.

    -ModifyResourceAccess <String>
        Describes how to modify a resource accesses of a resource when that resource is moved. Possible values are: `none`, `create`, and `delete`. The `none` value indicates that no resource access should be modified. The `create` value is used when a resource is moving out of a realm into the array and it needs to create a resource access of the moved resource to the realm from which it is moving. The `delete` value is used when a resource that is moving from an array into a realm already has a resource access into that realm. This is a required parameter when a resource is being moved to another member.

    -Array <Rest2Api>
        The PureArray object representing a connection to a Pure Storage FlashArray. Created using the `Connect-Pfa2Array` cmdlet.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named

        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -ContextNames <List<String>>
        Performs the operation on the context specified. If specified, the context names must be an array of size 1, and the single element must be the name of an array in the same fleet. If not specified, the context will default to the array that received this request.  Other parameters provided with the request, such as names of volumes or snapshots, are resolved relative to the provided `context`.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -DestroyContents <Boolean>
        (REST API 2.3+) Set to `$True` to destroy contents (e.g., volumes, protection groups, snapshots) and containers (e.g., realms, pods, volume groups), including eradicating containers with content.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named

        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Destroyed <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, the pod has been destroyed and is pending eradication. The `TimeRemaining` value displays the amount of time left until the destroyed pod is permanently eradicated. A pod can only be destroyed if it is empty, so before destroying a pod, ensure all volumes and protection groups inside the pod have been either moved out of the pod or destroyed. A stretched pod cannot be destroyed unless you unstretch it first. Before the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed pod can be recovered by setting `Destroyed=$False`. Once the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the pod is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.

    -PromoteFrom <String>
        (REST API 2.2+) The `undo-demote` pod that should be used to promote the pod. After the pod has been promoted, it will have the same data as the `undo-demote` pod and the `undo-demote` pod will be eradicated.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named

    -Quiesce <Boolean>
        (REST API 2.2+) Set to `$True` to demote the pod after the `pod-replica-link` goes into `quiesced` state and allow the pod to become a target of the remote pod. This ensures that all local data has been replicated to the remote pod before the pod is demoted.
        
        Required?                    false

    -RequestedPromotionState <String>
        (REST API 2.2+) Patch `RequestedPromotionState` to `demoted` to demote the pod so that it can be used as a link target for continuous replication between pods. Demoted pods do not accept write requests, and a destroyed version of the pod with `undo-demote` appended to the pod name is created on the array with the state of the pod when it was in the promoted state. Patch `RequestedPromotionState` to `promoted` to start the process of promoting the pod. The `promotion_status` indicates when the pod has been successfully promoted. Promoted pods stop incorporating replicated data from the source pod and start accepting write requests. The replication process does not stop when the source pod continues replicating data to the pod. The space consumed by the unique replicated data is tracked by the `space.journal` field of the pod.

    -SkipQuiesce <Boolean>
        (REST API 2.2+) Set to `$True` to demote the pod without quiescing the `pod-replica-link` and allow the pod to become a target of the remote pod. This stops all pending replication to the remote pod.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2PodReplicaLink
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.2+) Modify pod replica links
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2PodReplicaLink [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-LocalPodId <List<String>>] [-LocalPodName <List<String>>] [-Paused <Boolean>] [-RemoteId <List<String>>] [-RemoteName <List<String>>] [-RemotePodId <List<String>>] [-RemotePodName <List<String>>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies pod replica links. The `LocalPodName` and `RemotePodName` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `Paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

DESCRIPTION
    Modifies policy mappings of a replica link. Valid `Mapping` values are `connected` and `disconnected`. `connected` indicates that the source policy and its attachments will be mirrored on the target pod. `disconnected` indicates that the associated policy and its attachments are independent from any policy on the remote. This operation can only be performed on the target side of a pod replica link.

    -Security <List<String>>
        The security flavors to use for accessing files on this mount point. Values include `auth_sys`, `krb5`, `krb5i`, and `krb5p`. If the server does not support the requested flavor, the mount operation fails. This operation updates all rules of the specified policy. If `auth_sys`, the client is trusted to specify the identity of the user. If `krb5`, cryptographic proof of the identity of the user is provided in each RPC request. This provides strong verification of the identity of users accessing data on the server. Note that additional configuration besides adding this mount option is required to enable Kerberos security. If `krb5i`, integrity checking is added to krb5. This ensures the data has not been tampered with. If `krb5p`, integrity checking and encryption is added to `krb5`. This is the most secure setting, but it also involves the most performance overhead.

    -ContextNames <List<String>>
        Performs the operation on the context specified. If specified, the context names must be an array of size 1, and the single element must be the name of an array in the same fleet. If not specified, the context will default to the array that received this request.  Other parameters provided with the request, such as names of volumes or snapshots, are resolved relative to the provided `context`.

SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2PolicySmb [-AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled <Boolean>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-ContinuousAvailabilityEnabled <Boolean>] [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-Name <String>] [-PolicyName <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies one or more SMB policies. To enable a policy, set `Enabled=$True`. To disable a policy, set `Enabled=$False`. To enable access based enumeration, set `AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled=$True`. To disable access based enumeration, set `AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled=$False`. To enable continuous availability, set `continuous_availability=$True`. To disable continuous availability, set `continuous_availability=$False`. To rename a policy, set `PolicyName` to the new name. The `Id` or `Name` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AccessBasedEnumerationEnabled <Boolean>
        (REST API 2.4+) If set to `$True`, enables access based enumeration on the policy. When access based enumeration is enabled on a policy, files and folders within exports that are attached to the policy will be hidden from users who do not have permission to view them.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2RemoteProtectionGroup
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.1+) Modify a remote protection group
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2RemoteProtectionGroup [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-Name <String>] [-On <String>] [-TargetRetentionAllForSec <Int32>] [-TargetRetentionDays <Int32>] [-TargetRetentionPerDay <Int32>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies the snapshot retention schedule of a remote protection group. Also destroys a remote protection group from the offload target. Before the remote protection group can be destroyed, the offload target must first be removed from the protection group via the source array. The `On` parameter represents the name of the offload target. The `Id` or `Name` parameter and the `On` parameter are required and must be used together.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2SoftwareInstallation
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.3+) Modify software upgrade
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2SoftwareInstallation [-AddOverrideChecksArgs <List<String>>] [-AddOverrideChecksName <List<String>>] [-AddOverrideChecksPersistent <System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Boolean]>] [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] -Command <String> -CurrentStepId <String> [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies a software upgrade by continuing, retrying, or aborting it. All `override_checks` are updated before the command is issued if `add_override_checks` is present. The `override_checks` parameter is valid when `Command` is set to `continue` or `retry`.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AddOverrideChecksArgs <List<String>>
        The name of the specific check within the override check to ignore so that the system can continue with the software upgrade. The `AddOverrideChecksName` parameter of the override check must be specified with the `AddOverrideChecksArgs` parameter. For example, if the HostIOCheck check fails on hosts host01 and host02, the system displays a list of these host names in the failed check. To override the HostIOCheck checks for host01 and host02, set `AddOverrideChecksName=HostIOCheck`, and set `AddOverrideChecksArgs=host01,host02`. Enter multiple `AddOverrideChecksArgs`. Note that not all checks have `AddOverrideChecksArgs` values.
        
        reference: OverrideCheck
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -AddOverrideChecksName <List<String>>
        The name of the upgrade check to be overridden so the software upgrade can continue if the check failed or is anticipated to fail during the upgrade process. Overriding the check forces the system to ignore the check failure and continue with the upgrade. If the check includes more specific checks that failed or are anticipated to fail, set them using the `AddOverrideChecksArgs` parameter. For example, the HostIOCheck check may include a list of hosts that have failed or are anticipated to fail the upgrade check.
        
        reference: OverrideCheck
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Aliases                      none
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -AddOverrideChecksPersistent <System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Boolean]>
        If set to `$True`, the system always ignores the failure of the specified upgrade check and continues with the upgrade process.  If set to `$False`, the system ignores the failure of the specified upgrade check until the upgrade check finishes and the upgrade process is continued. For example, the `continue` command is successfully issued in an `interactive` mode, or the first upgrade check step successfully finishes in a `one-click` mode.

    -Command <String>
        A user command that interacts with the upgrade. Commands may only be issued when the upgrade is paused. Valid values are `continue`, `retry`, and `abort`. The `continue` command continues a `paused` upgrade. The `retry` command retries the previous step. The `abort` command aborts the upgrade.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2VirtualMachine
    
SYNOPSIS
    (REST API 2.10+) Update a virtual machine
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2VirtualMachine [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-Id <String>] [-SourceId <String>] [-SourceName <String>] [-VmId <String>] [-VmType <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Updates a virtual machine, recovering it from the destroyed state. If the virtual machine is of type `vvol`, the `source` property of the request body must be a `recovery_context` value retrieved from the `Get-Pfa2VirtualMachine /virtual-machines` endpoint. If recovering the virtual machine will cause a conflict with an existing virtual machine, the operation will fail.

DESCRIPTION
    Modifies a volume by renaming, destroying, or resizing it. To rename a volume, set `VolumeName` to the new name. To destroy a volume, set `Destroyed=$True`. To recover a volume that has been destroyed and is pending eradication, set `Destroyed=$False`. Set the bandwidth and IOPS limits of a volume through the respective `QosBandwidthLimit` and `QosIopsLimit` parameter. This moves the volume into a pod or volume group through the respective `pod` or `volume_group` parameter. The `Id` or `Name` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AddToProtectionGroupIds <List<String>>
        The volumes will be added to the specified protection groups along with creation or movement across pods and array. When a volume is moved, the specified protection groups must be in the target pod or array. Enter multiple ids.

After truncating a volume, its provisioned size can be subsequently increased, but the data in truncated sectors cannot be retrieved. If set to `$False` or not set at all and the volume is being reduced in size, the volume copy operation fails. Required if the `Provisioned` parameter is set to a volume size that is smaller than the original size.

DESCRIPTION
    Modifies a volume group. You can rename, destroy, recover, or set QoS limits for a volume group. To rename a volume group, set `VolumeGroupName` to the new name. To destroy a volume group, set `Destroyed=$True`. To recover a volume group that has been destroyed and is pending eradication, set `Destroyed=$False`. Sets the bandwidth and IOPS limits of a volume group through the respective `QosBandwidthLimit` and `QosIopsLimit` parameter. The `Id` or `Name` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together. Sets the priority adjustment for a volume group using the `PriorityAdjustmentOperator` and `PriorityAdjustmentValue` fields.

        (REST API 2.10+) Valid values are `+`, `-`, and `=`. The values `+` and `-` may be applied to volumes and volume groups to reflect the relative importance of their workloads. Volumes and volume groups can be assigned a priority adjustment of -10, 0, or +10. In addition, volumes can be assigned values of =-10, =0, or =+10. Volumes with settings of -10, 0, +10 can be modified by the priority adjustment setting of a volume group that contains the volume. However, if a volume has a priority adjustment set with the `=` operator (for example, =+10), it retains that value and is unaffected by any volume group priority adjustment settings.

NAME
    Update-Pfa2Workload
    
SYNOPSIS
    Modify a workload
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Pfa2Workload [-ApiVersion <String>] [-Array <Rest2Api>] [-ContextNames <List<String>>] [-Destroyed <Boolean>] [-Id <List<String>>] [-Name <String>] [-WorkloadName <String>] [-XRequestId <String>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Modifies a workload by renaming or destroying it. To rename a workload, set `WorkloadName` to the new name. To destroy a workload, set `Destroyed=$True`. To recover a workload that has been destroyed and is pending eradication, set `Destroyed=$False`. The `Id` or `Name` parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.

    -ContextNames <List<String>>
        Performs the operation on the context specified. If specified, the context names must be an array of size 1, and the single element must be the name of an array in the same fleet. If not specified, the context will default to the array that received this request.  Other parameters provided with the request, such as names of volumes or snapshots, are resolved relative to the provided `context`.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named

    -Destroyed <Boolean>
        If set to `$True`, destroys a resource. Once set to `$True`, the `TimeRemaining` value will display the amount of time left until the destroyed resource is permanently eradicated. Before the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed resource can be recovered by setting `Destroyed=$False`. Once the `TimeRemaining` period has elapsed, the resource is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
